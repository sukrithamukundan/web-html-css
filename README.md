# Website Template from scratch
This is a sample website prepared using HTML and CSS as a part of the online boot-camp conducted by the SHE organization of GCEK.

**Thinks that I tried out:**
1. Changing the color scheme .
2. Incorporating cool font using Google Fonts.
3. Creating a form where someone can enter their contact details.
4. Embeding youtube video.
5. Incorporating amazing icons using Fontawesome.
